After becoming a student at PJATK, I was extremely disappointed with lack of ability to receive notifications whenever
something is updated in the system (new announcements, forum entries, homework assignments).

`check-edux` allows you easily check for new updates in courses and global announcements via running a simple command
in your terminal: `check-edux`.
