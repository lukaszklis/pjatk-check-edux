After becoming a student at PJATK, I was extremely disappointed with lack of ability to receive notifications whenever
something is updated in the system (new announcements, forum entries, homework assignments).

`check-edux` allows you easily check for new updates in courses and global announcements via running a simple command
in your terminal: `check-edux`.

## Installation

```bash
npm i -g @lukaszklis/pjatk-check-edux
```

## How to use

Initialize the settings:

```bash
check-edux --init
```

From now on you can simply run the following:

```bash
check-edux
```

## Development

## Development flow

1. Clone this repository.
1. Install dependencies via: `yarn`.
1. Create necessary config files via: `yarn run config`.
